            for reflecting on the bittersweet change that accompanies growing up and the loss of the simplicity and
            simple joy of childhood. The journal reflects themes of fragmented modernity and intrinsic human needs. It
            is written in a font called POLSKA designed specifically for this project and features a poem written by
            Michael Schmiedicke, as well as musing thereupon by the artist. The process of writing and creating this
            paper woman serves as a mourning ritual for the artist, akin to ancient tradition of mourning rituals held
            by the artist’s Polish and German ancestors. The purpose of this piece is to hold space for the complicated
            feelings that accompany change and then in it’s completion, leave those feeling in peace.

            interviews with my family members. In these interviews, I explore my family’s ideas, hardships, teachings,

            interview text, which can be accompanied by the original recorded audio, should the viewer choose to wear
            the provided headphones. Every Day is Christmas follows my childhood as I discuss the hardships I faced at a
            young age and how I have overcome them, as well as how the hardships affected my parents and siblings. It
            delves deeper into my parents’ history and their thought process when it came to raising children. As the
            viewer follows the winding road, they will encounter laughter, silliness, sadness, tears, love, and many,
            many family photos.

            mixed mediums, to explore kinetic imaging and what animation can do within my graphic design practice. Each

            This project is inspired by my growing interest in 3D animation and projection mapping, but for this

            3D modeling to recreate my design, exported the finished design to be 3D printed, then created a physical
            Krōnē head. A silicon mold was created to quickly cast resin copies, and these have been painted and hidden
            around campus for anyone to find and take home. There have been 10 blank smaller heads placed around every
            week for the last month as “DIY toys” to paint or color, in hopes of creating an engaging community around
            an art toy posing as a blank canvas.

            an interaction between two people. The 8-shaft direct-tieup loom is a hybrid of many designs, but is unique
            in its focus not on the actual cloth it produces, but on what that cloth represents. This loom is not made
            for efficiency, for productivity, for practicality, or for profit. It’s a tool for documentation, archiving,
            and spending time with one another, creating something together.

            In <i>I Hate It Here</i>, I examine the transition from print to digital news media. Previously, newspapers
            dominated, printed overnight for mass consumption. Now, the internet offers limitless resources and instant
            news dissemination. I explore the pros and cons: the freedom from printed newspapers versus the mental
            health toll, misinformation, and other unforeseen consequences. Rooted in personal experience, this project
            challenges assumptions about the internet's role in our lives, inviting readers to reflect on the
            complexities of our digital age.

            1. a thing that is hoped or wished for but in fact is illusory or impossible to achieve.
            Chimera is a working reflexive dictionary, and a theoretical framework of intersectionality. Within nadia's
            practice, Chimera is a material study of color, live digital media and light, and a piece of their continued
            exploration of the in-betweens, productions and translations of identities at an individual, interpersonal
            and institutional level. Connections are drawn between the universal intuitive human experience of light and
            color relativity, and the unique experience of the self, the other(s) in the context of identity.
            Language familiar to color science, quantum physics, astronomy, and critical theories have been collected,
            defined, categorized, mapped, appropriated, re appropriated and synthesized into this expansive dictionary
            of universal concepts. The goal (always) being a step towards our individual and collective liberation.

            In the absence of light we cannot see color.
            In the absence of the other, we cannot see the self.

            Forgotten is a videogame in the making that is currently only sprite assets. It is a project that has needed months of research before starting with the expectation that it can eventually be uploaded into the Unity Game Engine with the hopes of becoming a real game in the near future. This research included figuring out how games are coded, how sizing is created for characters and maps, and how lighting and effects such as parallax backgrounds are made. The story revolves around the main character, who has forgotten who they are as well as being forgotten by others. To complete the game, the player must collect memory shards and explore the areas of the map to uncover who the main character really is.
