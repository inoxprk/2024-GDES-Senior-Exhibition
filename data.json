However, I believe this concept can be adapted and applied to platonic relationships as well. There is very little material on this topic, so l decided to develop my own concepts by learning from other friendship experiences.\n\nFrom my research, I felt people were missing out on a very key component to understanding the deep meaning of friendship as a whole due to the lack of platonic language representation. My project allows access to an approachable package that welcomes them regardless of their knowledge of the concept of different friendship dynamics.\n\nAs a final component, I developed a quiz for people take to discover what their platonic language is before they view the items within the box. When viewing my piece, there are 5 different ways, depending on your preference to learn about each language.",

Some of the visual identity taken from personal sense of connection to water based fauna fostered by aquatic environments, feeling a sense of relatability due to these creatures also  engaging with the world perceptually different than other people do at least tactilely. The outcome of all these explorations is a sensory box that you can enter and experience multiple tactile senses on the inside and outside of it. The goal is for the participants and observers to be able to interact with the piece, hopefully engaging in their own unique experience with the piece. The intention is to provide a closed space where the participant can have a moment of stillness, if they desire they can touch and interact with the structure, or they can just enjoy the visual experience.",

As a senior student\nin college, I want to record this time that we are facing the\nchanges or options after graduating. At this time, how do we\nshape ourselves to fit this new situation and what could we do\nin/for this society in the future? I see the real world as a new\nlearning environment, much like a child’s perspective. Viewing\nmyself as a child, I anticipate facing unknown challenges\nahead.

The <i>MotherBoard Archive</i> is a curated library of resources and media centered around navigating complex mother/daughter relationships, girlhood, self healing, and healing relational patterns. The digital archive functions as a gentle guide; a recipe for healing and self reflection. The MotherBoard archive can be engaged with purely as a resource library, or (by means of an interactive personality quiz function) as a way to generate a personalized list of resource and media recommendations based on the user’s specific need within this broader topic. This project is also about finding community within the complexities of these relationships. Using a handful of public engagement prompts I have also been gathering anonymous survey responses, voicemails, and text messages to help me understand where communication struggles exist within the context of mother/daughter or parent/child relationships. The user is also able to browse through a growing selection of these anonymous voicemail and text submissions. <a href=\"http://motherboardarchive.com/\">motherboardarchive.com</a>",

    "Project Description": "<i>The Art of Climate Education</i> aims to use art as a catalyst for change. This book is a collection of primarily installation based artworks that seek to educate viewers on climate issues and inspire them to take action. Each piece of art was selected based on its ability to convey an important message about the need to conserve our environment. Some works use appreciation as the motivating factor, while others propose solutions to how we might tangibly make a difference in protecting our world. The goal is to invite curiosity and inspire viewers to learn in a new way. During my time in GDES, I discovered my passion for designing informational publications for climate education. This project is a culmination of my love for art, research, bookbinding, and the desire to make a small impact on the world by inspiring someone to make a positive change in their lifestyle to help protect our Earth. <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h2-sQQftqQTJuMTKXJTmn00pWnlg73Fx/view?usp=sharing\">Read the full book here</a>.",

Working as a curator and designer of this exhibition, I came up with the entire identity for the exhibition. The bright and exciting colors present in the designs are a direct reflection of the colors used in her paintings. Amina uses her practice as a way to grieve and remember her ancestors, claiming that death is a “transitional release” and something that should be celebrated. The collection of paintings present in the exhibition is called “Scribbled with Love,” thus the scribbledness of the identity. I was intrigued by her bush strokes and the flow of her work, picking out specific strokes that stood out specifically for the identity. As well as designing the main logo and design of the exhibition, I have also created several other designs that would be present at the opening, such as tickets and postcards.Creating this exhibition identity has given me the opportunity to view death in a new way while also learning how to properly exhibit someone else’s work in a way that does it justice. ",

    "Project Description": "Mosaics and traditional Arabic embroidery have many similarities, both meticulous labors of love. Each stitch a tile; a piece of a larger whole. A single tessera or a cross-stitch on its own is beautiful in its simplicity, but add one more, then another, and another, and soon a narrative is born. But the effort behind these individually laid tiles/made stitches often go unnoticed in the places they live and the purposes they serve. Thus, I combined these two art forms by creating an embroidered mosaic of decorative ornamental patterns and designs. Whether the time and work put into this piece will go unnoticed remains to be seen.",

    "Project Description": "I have a great love for album art and creating work that interacts with music. Over the past few months, I collaborated with musicians of different genres to create three album artworks to build my portfolio. <i>Ride or Die or Both</i> is an album by Son of Soong, an artist heavily inspired by Star Trek and astronomy. For the album art, I created an illustration of Data’s face and the hand of Noonian Soong to reference the artist’s name directly (Data is an android created by Soong). <i>Moire</i> by Malaphor is an album currently in the making. It is an experimental album mixing different genres and sounds in a style reminiscent of Amon Tobin, Aphex Twin, Drumcorps, and Igorrr, among others. For the album art, I created a digital moire pattern with overlapping circles and vertical and horizontal lines with colors that relate to the musician’s aesthetic. <i>Dungeonscapes Vol. 2</i> by SNGN is part of an ongoing series of ambient albums meant for tabletop RPGs. I had created the album art for Dungeonscapes Vol. 1 back in 2020. For Dungeonscapes Vol. 2, I continued with a traditional painting to maintain the same aesthetic.\n",

The collection is titled <i>NEPTUNE</i>. The designs of my pieces draw inspiration from the ocean and its inhabitants, ranging from little critters in tidepools to the darkest abyssal trenches. Here, fish withstand the unholy water pressure while illuminating disarming bioluminescent beauty. All of the pieces are resin printed and 3D modeled using Blender and Nomad Sculpt. The pieces in the collection range from fluidic printed eyewear to spinning rings. I wanted each piece to exude avant-garde charm and feel like wearable art on the body. The colors used vary from shimmering silver reminiscent of moonlight on a watery horizon to shapeshifting hues of coral in one piece, changing color depending on the angle of the light, thus creating an enchanting play of color and shadow. Through the fusion of cutting-edge technology and timeless design, my aim is to create not just accessories, but artifacts that inspire wonder and curiosity and push the boundaries of fashion and art.",

    "Project Description": "Ever since I moved to a different country, memories of Korea have become more special, forming the core of my identity. I believe stone lithography has a strong correlation to memory and pearls. Oysters build layers on top of an irritant, using it as a nucleus, much like people build distorted layers on top of the original memory that fades. Stone lithography involves a significant amount of irritation of the surface and layers of grease that form the image. The series of prints, using my childhood home and lithography as the core, build layers on top of each other, combining them into the theme of memories and nostalgia.\n\nI am also interested in the process of digital degradation. In a similar way to how digital copies are made and circulated, memories can be linked to copies of experiences stored in our minds. Each time we recall a memory, it may degrade and become distorted, influenced by factors such as personal biases, emotions, and subsequent experiences. Just as digital images lose quality with each copy, memories may lose fidelity and accuracy over time. This creates room for imagination, and I believe the distorted layers of memories are what make nostalgia special. I aimed to visualize this idea in a format of digital web: <a href=\"https://nostalgia.city/\">nostalgia.city.</a>",

It profoundly reflects the collective spirit of resistance and the incredible power of unity against systemic injustices. Central to this installation is the use of burlap and mannequins, each chosen for their symbolic resonance and integral role in conveying the themes of human resilience, the flammability of change, and the faceless universality of the struggle for rights and recognition.\n\nBurlap, with its coarse texture and simple, unassuming presence, is the primary material in this sculpture, draped over mannequins to represent the masses standing in solidarity. This choice of fabric is pivotal, not only for its aesthetic and tactile qualities but for its symbolic weight. Burlap embodies the rugged endurance of the collective will, signifying the grassroots nature of social movements and the interconnectedness of individuals fighting for a common cause. It speaks to the strength found in unity and the rough-hewn, diverse fabric of society coming together to face systemic challenges.\n",

To challenge that, I made them the center of attention so that there is no way to ignore or remove them. The Hoodie Hat makes fun of the materials list and the odd things they are forced to disclose about what the clothing is made of.

    "Project Description": "<i>Recording Interface for Pair of Weavers</i> is a tool. The loom is intentionally designed for use by two people, weaving side by side simultaneously. Stemming from research into the archival and record keeping potential of handwoven cloth, the loom acts as an interface for the recording of an interaction between two people. The 8-shaft direct-tieup loom is a hybrid of many designs, but is unique in its focus not on the actual cloth it produces, but on what that cloth represents. This loom is not made for efficiency, for productivity, for practicality, or for profit. It’s a tool for documentation, archiving, and spending time with one another, creating something together.\n\nIt takes a village, and I would like to thank Justin, Annie, Elsie, Eileen, Hillary, Mishari, Joe, Piper, Emma, Gwen, Aimee, Ezra, Nora, Mom, Dad and all the other hands that helped put this thing together. This one’s for you Nate, miss you bud.\n",

    "Project Description": "First Last Words is a death writing prompt book. Writing about death is one way to face anxieties about it. My main goal in making this book was to help people facing fears of death, leading them to start talking about it more. \n\nIt covers almost all topics related to death, including death rituals, bucket lists, writing to loved ones who have passed, final words, final meals, and the afterlife, just to name a few. Everyone’s experience with death differs, which is heavily considered. Anyone and everyone can complete the prompts; they are left vague on purpose. \n\nMost prompts are journal-style, but there are a few creative writing, drawing, and collaging prompts throughout the book. The prompts are divided into segments: life, grief, dying, dead, and afterlife. Between each segment is a transition page that includes definitions you may need.",

It is a project that has needed months of research before starting with the expectation that it can eventually be uploaded into the Unity Game Engine with the hopes of becoming a real game in the near future. This research included figuring out how games are coded, how sizing is created for characters and maps, and how lighting and effects such as parallax backgrounds are made. The story revolves around the main character, who has forgotten who they are as well as being forgotten by others. To complete the game, the player must collect memory shards and explore the areas of the map to uncover who the main character really is. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOt_IenlTE8\">Here is the trailer</a>.",

    "Project Description": "This care package will consume of a couple of different guides to help navigate women in their twenties. Here we have a survival guide book, mini how to zines, a planner, and some stickers. These together as a care package are encompass the idea that stemmed from just the survival guide book. The survival guide showcases chapters that illuminate different types of topics such as finance, self care, independent responsibilities (etc). The mini how to zines stem from each chapter in the survival guide, the purpose it holds is because it's so mini, you are just able to put it in your pocket! As a woman going through her twenties right now, I wish I had a guide or multiple guides to assist me even before entering my twenties. I want this care package to be a helping hand for all the women out there who are struggling on knowing where to start their journey as a twenty something year old. ",

Inspired by the process of writing in a dream journal, I aim to craft audio-visual worlds that bring me closer to home, myself, and my dreams.\nIn this project, I explore the boundaries of reality and imagination, inviting audiences to immerse themselves in surreal environments that blur the lines between the conscious and subconscious.

    "Project Description": "Chimera\n1. a thing that is hoped or wished for but in fact is illusory or impossible to achieve.\nChimera is a working reflexive dictionary, and a theoretical framework  of intersectionality. Within nadia's practice, Chimera is a material study of color, live digital media and light, and a piece of their continued exploration of the in-betweens, productions and translations of identities at an individual, interpersonal and institutional level. Connections are drawn between the universal intuitive human experience of light and color relativity, and the unique experience of the self, the other(s) in the context of identity. \nLanguage familiar to color science, quantum physics, astronomy, and critical theories have been collected, defined, categorized, mapped, appropriated, re appropriated and synthesized into this expansive dictionary of universal concepts. The goal (always) being a step towards our individual and collective liberation. \n\nIn the absence of light we cannot see color.\nIn the absence of the other, we cannot see the self. \n\nsee the work →<a href=\"https://chimera.nadiahali.com/\">chimera.nadiahali.com</a>",
